Central St Giles, Bloomsbury, &copy; Hufton Crow.

In 2010, Arup provided engineering consultancy services for the redevelopment of Central St Giles, London. **Oasys Frew** was used to design the flexible cantilever retaining walls forming the new basement. Part 1 of this case study introduced the site's obstructions, ground conditions and the parameters used when modelling the flexible retaining wall.

We revisited the Central St Giles design models covered in Part 1, this time comparing Gofer and **Plaxis**.

## What changed?

A prop structural element was installed at a 22.61m elevation at [Stage 3](#stage-3) of the construction sequence, during the excavation of the upper material (Made Ground).

The prop replicates the effect of a 150mm thick concrete basement slab. 

The image below shows a visual representation of the Gofer model, with a prop.

### How it compares: Results

Again, displacement, bending moment and shear forces were all tested. The results below show the forces recorded at the prop in both Gofer and Plaxis, and show that these values compare well.

#### Stage 3

Gofer: 94.1 kN/m 

Plaxis: 99.6 kN/m 

#### Stage 4

Gofer: 156.3 kN/m 

Plaxis: 155.8 kN/m
